Day 2: Highest Cost Orders

Problem Statement: Find the customer with the highest daily total order cost between 2019-02-01 to 2019-05-01. If customer had more than one order on a certain day, sum the order costs on daily basis. Output customer's first name, total cost of their items, and the date.
 For simplicity, you can assume that every first name in the dataset is unique.
 
 Query:
    with summary as (select c.first_name,o.order_date, sum(o.total_order_cost) daily_sum from customers c join orders o on
    c.id = o.cust_id
    where o.order_date between '2019-2-1' AND '2019-5-1'
    GROUP BY c.first_name,
    o.order_date)
    select * from summary where daily_sum = (select max(daily_sum) from summary) 
    ;
